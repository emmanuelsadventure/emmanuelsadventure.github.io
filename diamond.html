	The Monk Diamond is famous for its distinctive green color. A Russian nobleman bought
	<br/>the diamond for his wife in 1889, but it was stolen during the Russian Revolution. For
	<br/>the next thirty years, the Monk Diamond's whereabouts were unknown. In 1947, it was
	<br/>discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in Moscow. It was returned
	<br/>to the nobleman's family. The nobleman's son decided that the Monk Diamond was
	<br/>unlucky and sold it to the House of Volkov, Moscow's oldest jewelery house. The House of
	<br/>Volkov paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumored to be the most expensive
	<br/>diamond sale ever.
